## 🔧 Additional Multiplayer Polish Tracking (Recent Session)

The following multiplayer diagnostic & reliability polish items were added/refined:

- Snapshot mismatch counters with auto full-sync request (after 2 mismatches, 3s cooldown)
- Remote version ahead detection flag exposed in debug overlay
- Patch efficiency metrics persisted across refresh (sessionStorage)
- Lock contention wait-time aggregation (waited acquisitions, total & avg wait ms)
- Debug panel enhancements: mismatch info, remote version ahead, wait metrics, efficiency ratio
- Auto integrity verification on risky diff patches (roomProgress/currentRoom)

Remaining recommended polish:
1. Diff/apply stress test harness script
2. README: Snapshot schema + versioning explanation
3. More granular lock wait distribution (p50/p95) if needed
4. Downgrade (server ahead) safe-mode apply strategy (currently only flagged)
5. Escalation/backoff after repeated auto full-syncs
6. Persist lockStats across reloads
7. Unit tests for checksum & diff builder

Next larger phase focus candidates:
- Persistent sessions (Redis / durable store)
- Lobby & join-code workflow refinement
- Historical analytics aggregation & dashboard UI
- Role-based authorization & audit logging
- Structured test suite (Vitest/Jest) for engine modules
